# Implementing you module

In this application, we're going to start writing our module code. The module we will write will expose a single API that will reverse a sentence pass to it. We'll also install a popular code formatter to keep our module code consistent.

## Getting Ready

Ensure that we create a directory for the application. In our case the application directory is **02-recipe-implementing-your-module**. Cd into that directory.

Initialize the project and ensure that the **package.json** is present in the root directory

We'll also need to create the first JavaScript file for our module.

# 07-recipe-transforming-data-with-transform-pipe

In this example, we are going to create a transform stream using Node.js core **stream** module.
The transform stream we will create, will convert all the text from our file to UPPERCASE.

Transform streams  allow us to consume input data, then process that data, and then output the data in processed form.
We can use transform streams to handle data manipulation, functionally and asynchronously.

## Run

To run the example:

> npm start

or

> node transform-stream.js

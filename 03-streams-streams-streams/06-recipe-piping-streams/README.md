# 06-recipe-piping-streams

A pipe is a form of one way redirection. Similar to how we use pipe in our shells to pipe outputs between programs, we can also use Node.js `pipe()` method to pipe data between streams. 

In this example, we will learn how to use the `pipe()` method.
We will learn how to pipe a readable stream to a writeable stream.

## Run

To run the program:

> npm start

or

> node pipe-stream.js

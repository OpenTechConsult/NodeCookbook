# Exploring Node.js Web Frameworks

Node.js can be used to build a variety of systems, including microservices, real-time applications such as chatbots, and even robotics.

One of the common use case for Node.js is building web applications.
Node.js core provides a range of low-level APIs that allow us to build
web applications. As this use case is so common, many web frameworks
have been created to abstract web protocols into higher-level APIs for
building web frameworks.

In this section we are going to build web applications using several of the
most popular web frameworks to gain an understanding of their differences and
similarities, and their suitability for specific tasks.

This section will cover the following:

- Building web applications with Express.js
- Building web applications with Koa.js
- Building web applications with Fastify
- Building web applications with Hapi

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this section are minimal. You should have Node.js installed, preferably the latest version Node.js 16, and access to an editor  and browser of your choice.

Throughout the projects, we'll be installing modules from **npm** registry - an internet connection will be required to download modules from the registry.

The code for the recipes will be available on GitHub.
